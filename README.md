# Week One - RA
This project is a simple mock bakery page using only html and css. 
Grids were used for the layout. This page isn't responsive... yet. 
When hovering over the product picture, the images will enlarge. Css transforms were used for this effect. 
When hovering over the buttons, they change color to signal the user an action. 
Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
